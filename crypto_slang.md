# Your Step-by-step Guide to Chinese Crypto Slang 🦧👀
For those interacting with Chinese crypto groups, you may get frustrated quickly if you can’t read some of the seemly strange phrases being thrown around.

Why are people in WeChat groups saying things like “don‘t ask, just 梭哈 (sūo hā)”? You’ll also hear people throwing strange insults like “you are such a 韭菜 (jiǔ cài / leek)”

Chinese crypto jargon, once used primarily for internal jokes in the early days of crypto chats like WeChat crypto groups or online forums, has now become part of the industry conversation.

1. 币圈 (Bì quān) — Literal meaning “coin circle.” Refers to the crypto space.
